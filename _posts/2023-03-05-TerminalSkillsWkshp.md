Studying computer science means using with the command line on a daily basis,
but sometimes it can be hard to understand what it is we’re really doing. If
you want to get a better grasp on how to interact with your terminal, then fear
not: _the [TUGSLUG](https://tugslug.org/ "The GNU/Linux User Group") has you
covered!_ On Sunday, March 5 we’ll be hosting our **Terminal Survival Skills
Workshop**. We're going to be discussing tips, tricks, and shortcuts that will
make your life as a CS student easier. It's in Barnum 104 at 1:00 pm, and all
levels of experience are welcome. We hope to see you there!
