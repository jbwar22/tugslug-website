It's that time of the year: the end of the semester. That can mean only one
thing... _the third semiannual LAN Party!_ This time around we'll be playing
Quake III: Arena! It's cross-platform, so there's no need to worry about
compatibility issues! Drop on by and blow off some steam as we become epic 
gamers.
