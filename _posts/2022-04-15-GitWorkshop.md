Tuftsâ€™ unofficial GNU/Linux User Group has organized another workshop. This time, we'll be teaching git. If you don't know what git is, it's version management software, or more simply, a tool that can let you collaborate on code as well as track iterations of your work as you make changes. You can use it to do things such as restore previous versions of code, develop different sections at the same time as someone else, and much more.

We'll be going over how to use Tufts' GitLab server or GitHub to collaborate, and all of the necessary git tools to get you started.
