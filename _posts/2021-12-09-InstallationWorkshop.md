On Sunday, December 12th, we are hosting an installation workshop in Tisch 226 from 1:00pm to 3:00pm. The workshop will be an opportunity to install GNU/Linux on virtual machines, USB sticks, old computers, or even your own device. Help will be available if you have questions or get stuck, and there will be a few demonstration devices.
