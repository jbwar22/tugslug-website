Did you know that there are more text editors than there are stars in
the universe? It's true! You may have heard of VSCode and Atom, and
probably use one of them for CS assignments, but there are so many
more options. In fact, many editors can run inside a terminal, over
*just* an ssh connection. Such editors — including vim, micro, nano,
ed, and even emacs — are beloved by many of the greatest computer
scientists of our time, and are sure to greatly enhance your own
productivity. Whether you want to develop a new skill, are interested
in a niche part of programming culture, or just want to get
assignments done more quickly, learning about command-line text
editors is an excellent opportunity.

Tufts' unofficial GNU/Linux User Group has organized a workshop, to be
held on February 27th, 2022 in room 265 of the Joyce Cummings Center, 
where you can learn more about command-line
text editors in a low-pressure, hands-on way. No registration is
necessary.
