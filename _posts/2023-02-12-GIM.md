It's the (uhhh) GNU/Linux User Group's General Interest Meeting, or the
TUGSLUG's GIM if you really like your acronyms. It'll be run pretty much the
same as a regular meeting, but more general and more interesting! Dropping on
by is a great way of showing support for the TUGSLUG. So come on down, bring
your friends, and chat with us about Linux and stuff!
